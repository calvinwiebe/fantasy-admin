### Fantasy Admin UI

## Dependencies

1. [rethinkdb](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/)
Unfortunatelyyyyy there isn't a windows binary. I didn't think about this. We could either
always use one on heroku, or use something else. For Windows, just use virtualbox and an ubuntu install

2. [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Unfortunatelllyyyyy the emailing libraries require python. 2.x.x


## Install & Run

```
> npm install
> cake build
> cake dev
```
